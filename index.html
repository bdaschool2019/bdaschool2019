<b>EIT Digital Summer School on Big Data Analytics</b> is a two week event in Stockholm (Aug. 5-16, 2019) open to EIT Digital Master School students as well as external students from Europe.
The goal of this summer school is to teach advanced topics related to algorithms and platforms for Big Data as well as to enhance the innovation and entrepreneurial awareness among students.
Students following this school will attend lectures from leading researchers and practitioners from academia and industry.
The technical lectures will be woven together with the Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&E) aspects of using leading edge technology in data science to create new businesses. This will be introduced through lectures, workshops, public seminar, and hands-on supervising.
Throughout two weeks, the students will work in teams of four to six students on projects that will be initiated with an innovation competition workshop.
During the workshop, representatives from Stockholm City working in the area of data analytics will present their current challenges and opportunities, so that the students can get inspired and build their business proposals based on real cases.
The technical content of the school will be delivered during the 1st week and will focus on algorithms and tools for processing and analyzing massive data.
During the second week the students will use their newly acquired knowledge and skills to work on their cases complemented with I&E lectures to help structure their business plans and pitches.
The projects will be done in collaboration with the aforementioned companies and startups and thus will make these exercises as real as possible.
